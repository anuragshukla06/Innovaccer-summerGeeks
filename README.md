* One host can create multiple meetings but he cannot create meetings with same name.

* I have implemented token system for checking out and manage meetings

I have used Twilio's services for SMS. Their sms comes a little slow in our country (can take hours). Also, they send sms to verified numbers. So, I have verified a public number. You can see the sms generated here: https://www.receive-sms-online.info/917526812579-India along with other public messages. (If my free account's credits exhausts, sms won't come :( either way you can see my implementation.)
